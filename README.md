  Trade Amount      \$1-\$5 per trade                      Minimizes risk while learning
  Expiration Time   1-5 minutes                            Short-term trades for quick feedback
  Asset Selection   Major Currency Pairs (e.g., EUR/USD)   High liquidity and lower volatility

### Step 3: Learning to Read Charts

#### How to Read Candlestick Charts

1\. Identify the Candles: Each candle represents a specific time frame.
A green (or white) candle indicates a price increase, while a red (or
black) candle shows a decrease. 2. Analyze Patterns: Look for patterns
like Doji, Hammer, and Engulfing, which can indicate potential price
reversals or continuations. 3. Use Indicators: Apply indicators like
Moving Averages (MA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to add context to
the patterns you observe.

### Step 4: Developing a Simple Trading Strategy

#### Moving Average Crossover Strategy

This strategy involves using two moving averages---a short-term (e.g.,
10-period MA) and a long-term (e.g., 50-period MA). When the short-term
MA crosses above the long-term MA, it signals a potential upward trend
(a buy signal). Conversely, when the short-term MA crosses below the
long-term MA, it indicates a potential downward trend (a sell signal).

### Step 5: Implementing Risk Management

\* Set a Stop-Loss: Determine the maximum amount you are willing to lose
on a single trade (typically 1-2% of your trading account balance). \*
Diversify Trades: Don't put all your money into one trade. Spread your
investment across multiple trades and assets. \* Avoid Overtrading:
Stick to a trading plan and avoid making impulsive trades based on
emotions.

### Step 6: Testing and Adjusting Your Strategy

\* Track Your Trades: Keep a trading journal to document your trades,
strategies used, and outcomes. \* Analyze Results: Review your journal
regularly to identify patterns or mistakes. Adjust your strategy as
needed based on your findings. \* Be Patient: Successful trading
requires time and practice. Don't rush the process or get discouraged by
initial losses.
